        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Nigeria, by my Christian parents.
             I am still a Christian by the way. But I left for the united states to further my education at 19.
              I am ambivert by nature. I'm only social when its necessary, if not I prefer my space most of the time. 
              I graduated with my first degree in biology from a community college, an I wanted to further my education into being a nurse. But life happened and I need to do something with my life.

        <h2>Why I Joined ALT SCHOOL</h2>
        <p>First of all,  I'm a returning student, I initially started with data analyst program, but before the program ended, I felt the urge to transition to cloud engineering. They kinda work hand in hand for me, even though i can't place my finger on what the relationship is yet. I joined because I wanna do more with data.
